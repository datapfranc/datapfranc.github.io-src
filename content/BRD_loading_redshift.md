This post will go through the steps needed to set-up a new Redshift cluster and get data into it.  We'll be using a standard approach but there are many alternatives, see [here](https://www.blendo.co/amazon-redshift-guide-data-analyst/import-and-export-data/load-data-into-amazon-redshift/) for more details.  For the sake of simplicity, we assume a number of ETL jobs already exist to generate the presentation-layer data as flat files.  In real life, these ETL jobs would hold and maintain our set of Business rules and transformation logic required by our project, but for now we only focus on loading mechanisms involved with Redshift.

### Setting up an Amazon Redshift Cluster

The pre-requisite for setting-up the Cluster are:
  1. [**AWS account**](http://aws.amazon.com/) with a valid phone number
  2. [**IAM role**](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html) for granting access from one AWS resource to another one (in our case Redshift cluster connecting to our S3 bucket needed by the `COPY` command)
  3. SQL client (any JDBC/ODBC compatible client)
  4. [Redshift JDBC driver](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html#download-jdbc-driver), note the jdbc URL format for Redshift cluster: `jdbc:redshift://endpoint:port/databasename`

Once we have our pre-requisite cleared, we can spawn a new Cluster using the Amazon Redshift [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift) and follow basic instructions.  Important parameters to set are:

  - Cluster identifier (unique key to identify our cluster)
  - Physical location or region where our cluster will live
  - Database name and port (default port is 5439)
  - Master username and password ("superuser" of our database having same privileges as database owners but for all databases)
  - [Node type](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html):
      * Dense storage suited for large data workloads based on HDD storage: **DS1** & **DS2** (both have same storage but DS2 has more RAM/CPU) with different sizes (xlarge and 8xlarge)
      * Dense compute suited for performance intensive workloads based on SDD storage: **DC1** with different size (large and 8xlarge)
  - Cluster type (single or multiple nodes)
  - Some other advanced parameters like type of Platform (EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC), Encryption, CloudWatch alarm, etc.
  - **IAM role** associated with the cluster
      * Here we set the role explained in pre-requisite that lets Redshift accessing S3 in read-only

I do not provide more details configuration info, but overall the AWS and Redshift web UI is very clear and user friendly and things are easily configured straight from the web app!  It takes 1 or 2 minutes to create and launch your Cluster... pretty cool stuff!!  

Finally before being able to connect to the cluster, we need to configure authorization by defining a [security group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/rs-gsg-authorize-cluster-access.html). Different parameters like protocol, port range and connecting IP inbound rules need to be set and vary slightly depending on the type of platform created earlier (either a classic or a VPC).

At this stage, we can finally connect to the Cluster using various client like the terminal-based [psql](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/app-psql.html) or any GUI like SQuirreL SQL or Workbench/J.  The connection details to provide are the host (the endpoint defined previously), the userid (our master username), the port and the database name we decided to use.  


1 NODE dc1.large  or 4 Nodes (all nodes have same spec) :
Current Node Type : 	dc1.large
CPU :    	7 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores) per node
Memory per node : 	15 GiB per node
Storage Disk  : 	160GB SSD storage per node
I/O performance : Moderate
Platform Processor architecture :  	64-bit

### Loading into Redshift

Assuming we have our physical data model created in the database (DDL commands executed) we can start loading data into Redshift (link to previous post).

The recommended approach for loading flat files is to first dump the files into a [S3 bucket] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html), i.e. an URI named resource that stores files onto Amazon Cloud storage service.  We could use the same AWS account created to launch our Amazon Redshift cluster (credentials: an access key ID and secret access key).

#### Splitting input files

COPY command can take advantage of MPP to parallelize the loading of large files. This requires to split input files as a multiple of number of slices present in our cluster.  For example, this command would split 'review.txt' files into chunk of 500MB with prefix 'review_part_' :

```bash
split -b 100m review.txt review_part_
```

#### COPY command

The generic [`LOAD`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html) command supports various input type (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, local files, remote files accessed though SSH...) and offers a array of parameters to tune and customize the load.  

For instance, for loading DIM_DATE:

```sql
copy dim_date from 's3://<name-of-bucket>/<path-to-file>'
credentials 'aws_iam_role=<iam-role-identifier>'
delimiters '|' region 'eu-central-1a';

--Check loading errors at:
select * from stl_load_errors

```

In case of failure, we can check and debug the errors logged at `STL_LOAD_ERRORS`.  Also, because we used the `COPY` command Redshift determined automatically the compression encoding most suited to each attributes.  


#### Review table settings

Once all data was loaded, we can review and check all settings and table physical statistics with this query:

```sql
select schema schemaname
        , "table" tablename
        , table_id tableid
        , size size_in_mb
        , case when diststyle not in ('EVEN','ALL') then 1 else 0 end has_dist_key
        , case when sortkey1 is not null then 1 else 0 end has_sort_key
        , case when encoded = 'Y' then 1 else 0 end has_col_encoding
        , cast(max_blocks_per_slice - min_blocks_per_slice as FLOAT) / greatest(nvl(min_blocks_per_slice,0)::int,1) ratio_skew_across_slices
        , cast(100*dist_slice as FLOAT) /(select count(distinct slice) from stv_slices) pct_slices_populated
from svv_table_info ti
  join
(select tbl
        , min(c) as min_blocks_per_slice
        , max(c) as max_blocks_per_slice
        , count(distinct slice) dist_slice
from (select b.tbl, b.slice, count(1) as c from stv_blocklist b group by 1,2)
where tbl in (select table_id from svv_table_info)
group by tbl) iq on iq.tbl = ti.table_id;
```

We can also check the compression encoding chosen by Redshift for each column of a particular table:

```sql
select * from pg_table_def where tablename = 'review';
```

### Running queries

At this point, let's run a few queries.

Remind that no sort key are yet defined for any tables in our sub-optimal physical design.  To optimize this, we could also add sort-key but for now it is more interesting to see the impact on adding cluster nodes ...

After re-running the Query a multiple times, we can easily check the impact of our optimization by viewing the queries auditing info on logged by Redshift:


```sql
select starttime, querytxt, datediff(seconds, starttime, endtime) as elapse_sec
from stl_query
where starttime >= '2016-08-17 10:00' and endtime < '2016-08-17 23:59'
and database = 'brd'
order by starttime
;
```

Next, we'll try the MPP capability by configuring our Cluster with 4 nodes instead of 1 as currently set.

Result of different Query response time for different set-up.  Response time are calculated by averaging same queries executed non- sequentially for 5 times

| Query | **1 Node dc1.large** | **4 Nodes dc1.large** cluster | **Baseline commodity server (iMAC ...)** |
|----|----|----|---|
| Trend rating | 1916 | 498  |  |
| Cultural difference | 3043 | 433 |  |

| Helpful difference rating | 1649 | 508 |  |
| Stats per site | 2354 | 553 |  |

Note: Response time are in milliseconds.

Note2:  I actually kill/spawn/re-load a new Cluster with 4 nodes to do this perf comparison.  I realized after, that I could have simply resize my 1 Node cluster directly through the drop-down menu Cluster/Resize ... and let Redshift does this automatically (big time saving).

The only constraint of doing this way: "Warning: Resizing the cluster will cause it to be restarted into read-only mode for the duration of the resize operation. All currently executing queries and database connections on the cluster will be terminated when the resize operation begins and again when it is complete"
