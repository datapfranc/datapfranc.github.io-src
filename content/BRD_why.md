### Passion

To keep on working on any personal project you need above all **motivation**.  Without any constraints or external pressure to work on something, what can help you maintain motivation? Are factors like potential gain, popularity or recognition enough? Answer from personal experience: no.. these probably help at the beginning, but on the long run they'll leave you unfulfilled.

So what else can bring you lasting motivation? One word: passion!  Working on stuff compatible with personal interest will make work less like *work* and more like *leisure*! Personally, I enjoy working on data-oriented projects. So if I can find a subject that is appealing to me, then I'm all well. Like most people, there are a lot of subjects I find interesting, but the challenge is to find one where some data content exist out there that can easily be integrated inside a database.

While procrastinating on book reviews sites, it hit me... that's it, I had found it, [BRD]({filename}pages/Home.md) was just born!  Although I would not qualify myself as a literary person, I enjoy reading books and reviews like [this one](https://www.librarything.com/work/23078/reviews/67790839) or [that one](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/9230871?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1) could convince anyone to (re)read any book!


### Report on Book review

I'm not sure how valuable these book reviews are by themselves... but they are certainly interesting and fun to read!  What sort of questions could we get from a BRD dataset?  Here are some thoughts:

1. Trend of rating in time
2. Reader appreciation in terms of their demographics
3. Difference in rating depending on how helpful reviews are
4. Reviews/rating statistics difference per site
5. Finding same or similar reviews and reviewer

There are certainly many more I can't envision at this time.

### Next steps

To make this happen, I need to work on quite a few things: 1) design a data model, 2) develop pipeline from harvesting step to loading into a database, 3) setting up the DB and pipeline workflow environment, 4) define and implement visualization tool, 5) define the backend Cloud provider, etc.

Technology wise, here are some libraries/tools I'll be using:

* Postgres for the DB (planning to store integration data locally and not in Cloud)
* [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) used as the elt/pipeline framework (with some customization)
* [Scrapy](scrapy.org) for the web harvesting bit
* Still not sure on the visualization side
* [Python](https://www.python.org) for pretty much all the glue around each component

So let's jump at it.
